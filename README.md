# Amazon-MTurk-HIT-Poster

A Python script that serves as a general template for Python users to follow when posting HITS to Amazon Mechanical Turk. The script is written in Python and uses the Boto3 library to enables users to make posting multiple variations of HITS from the command line without code duplication of the script itself.
